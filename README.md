# Angular Component Example

This is a neat way to to leverage Angular UI Router and NodeJS to build Angular Style Components.  Using the multiline module 
you can add your templates to the same module as your controller
and url.  Then using the angular-ui-router you can wire up your
states in the config section.  This would enable you to build components as npm modules and share them very easily accross
applications.

To give it a try:

* check out this repo
* npm install
* npm start
